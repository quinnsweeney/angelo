            I exclusively use 1821 Man Made hair products because they embody
            the essence of a timeless gentleman. Their aesthetic is nothing
            short of iconic, combining sophistication, quality, and uniqueness
            to deliver results that rival professional standards. The brand's
            name pays homage to the 18th and 21st amendmentsâ€”the former marking
            the start of Prohibition in the early 1900s and the latter
            symbolizing the era's famed bootlegging culture. This rebellious,
            inventive spirit is infused into every aspect of the brand. Back
            then, materials had a weight and durability that reflected their
            quality, and 1821 draws on that tradition by incorporating those
            old-school values into modern formulations. By pairing premium
            craftsmanship with cutting-edge ingredients, they achieve top-tier
            performance while being mindful of health and well-being.
